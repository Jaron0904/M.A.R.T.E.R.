# M.A.R.T.E.R.
This repository contains all code used for the development of the M.A.R.T.E.R. tool. All code was written in C++ with the intention on being used with Arduino Nano microcontrollers. The system itself is designed to test electrical wiring in a cosntruction setting.

This repository contains the following iterations:

## M.A.R.M.O.T. 
This is the first version and was only meant to navigate a rudimentairy menu using four buttons. Aditionally two LED's were added to provide feedback about the system status

## M.A.R.T.E.R.
This second iteration is already functional but still requires the user to manually start tests.

Bugs:
- quickly repeating the test results in errors
- deducting cables is delayed in comparison to the addition

## S-M.A.R.T.E.R.
The third iteration automatically chekcs how many cables are connected and only updates the screen when a change has been made

Bugs:
- deducting cables is delayed in comparison to the addition
